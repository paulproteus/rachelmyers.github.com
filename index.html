    <h2 class="date"> March 2011 - Present (started as Associate Engineer)</h2>
      <div class="projects">
        <h4>Designed and built several pieces of a service-oriented architecture, including Be The Buyer and Comments Service.</h4>
        <div class="soa">
          <h4>A 'Be the Buyer' voting app was the first customer-facing app developed independently of the main rails app: </h4>
          <ul class="details">
            <li> For a smooth user experience, all customer-facing app share sessions and sign in logic.</li>
            <li> We collaborated with design to build the app responsively; the same views are work on all device resolutions and screen sizes.</li>
            <li>All common logic and assets needed across apps are encapsulated in private gems that can be included anywhere; for example, admin user authentication and fetching product images at the right sizse and resolution.</li>
            <li>We siloed the admin tools in an engine that is currently mounted in the customer facing app, but can easily be separated. Modularity was the rule.</li>
            <li> For internal reporting we migrated data from the highly coupled models of the large app to a few small, modular models. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Comments Service, a backend service auto moderating comments throughout the site:</h4>
          <ul class="details">
            <li>History of human moderations trained a baysian filter (Anakusa gem) that estimates a comment's similarity to good or bad comments.</li>
            <li>Built to only know or care about comments so it can be consumed widely (sample comments, community posts, and product reviews)</li>
            <li>Again, for internal reporting, we migrated data from confusing, coupled models to a simple, straightforward models.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Backbone-based mobile web:</h4>
        <ul class="details">
          <li> To provide a better experience on phones, we built backbone models and views on top of Rails routes, controllers and models. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Solr-based categories:</h4> 
        <ul class="details">
          <li>The presentation-layer product categories became indexed solr queries based on product properties.</li>
          <li>We additionally created a parsing tool to let merchandising create new categories quickly.</li>
          <li>Solr-based categories were the technical down payment for filter-based shopping; filters somewhat simply added parameters to the search query.</li>
          <li>We created a middleware rack app to quickly redirect old urls (way faster than rails).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Password security:</h4>
        <ul class="details">
          <li>As a hack day project I created a system to encrypt user passwords more securely, and became the local password security curmudgeon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Just for fun:</h4>
        <ul class="details">
          <li>CFO (Chief Fun Officer) of Mobile Web and SOA teams</li>
